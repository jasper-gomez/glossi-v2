### 💡Objective
Glossi 2.0 aims to create a digital simulation of the hair data I gathered during Glossi 1.0. Through an interdisciplinary analytical pipeline (Machine Learning + Stochastic System Dynamics + HPC), this models the dynamics of hair dryness.

### ⚙️Methodology
1. **Data Gathering**: Data used is from Glossi 1.0.
2. **Data Preprocesing**: The data has undergone numerical encoding using `LabelEncoder`, feature selection using [`FeSeCo`](https://github.com/jasper-gomez/feature-selection-companion), and feature engineering.
3. **Model Development**: Developed a simple Linear Regression (LR) model.
4. **Coefficient Extraction**: Using the LR model, the coefficients and intercept have been used as empirical ground truth for system parameters.
5. **Simulation Modeling**: Created a Stochastic SD model in Vensim.
6. **Probabilistic Analysis**: Leveraged parallel programming to execute high-throughput Monte Carlo sampling.
